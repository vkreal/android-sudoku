<p>Number puzzles first appeared in newspapers in the late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting with removing numbers from <a href="/wiki/Magic_squares" class="mw-redirect" title="Magic squares">magic squares</a>. <i>Le Siècle</i>, a Paris-based daily, published a partially completed 9×9 magic square with 3×3 sub-squares in 1892.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[19]</a></sup> It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column and sub-square added up to the same number.</p>

<p>Within three years <i>Le Siècle's</i> rival, <i>La France</i>, refined the puzzle so that it was almost a modern Sudoku. It simplified the 9×9 magic square puzzle so that each row and column contained only the numbers 1–9, but did not mark the sub-squares. Although they are unmarked, each 3×3 sub-square does indeed comprise the numbers 1–9. However, the puzzle cannot be considered the first Sudoku because, under modern rules, it has two solutions. The puzzle setter ensured a unique solution by requiring 1–9 to appear in both diagonals.</p>
<p>These weekly puzzles were a feature of newspaper titles including <i>L'Echo de Paris</i> for about a decade but disappeared about the time of the <a href="/wiki/First_World_War" class="mw-redirect" title="First World War">First World War</a>.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Will_Shortz" title="Will Shortz">Will Shortz</a>, the modern Sudoku was most likely designed anonymously by <a href="/wiki/Howard_Garns" title="Howard Garns">Howard Garns</a>, a 74-year-old retired architect and freelance puzzle constructor from <a href="/wiki/Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and first published in 1979 by <a href="/wiki/Dell_Magazines" title="Dell Magazines">Dell Magazines</a> as <i>Number Place</i> (the earliest known examples of modern Sudoku). Garns's name was always present on the list of contributors in issues of <i>Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games</i> that included <i>Number Place</i>, and was always absent from issues that did not.<sup id="_ref-Garns_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garns" title="">[11]</a></sup> He died in 1989 before getting a chance to see his creation as a worldwide phenomenon.<sup id="_ref-Garns_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garns" title="">[11]</a></sup> It is unclear if Garns was familiar with any of the French newspapers listed above.</p>

<p>The puzzle was introduced in Japan by <a href="/wiki/Nikoli" title="Nikoli">Nikoli</a> in the paper <i>Monthly Nikolist</i> in April 1984<sup id="_ref-Garns_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Garns" title="">[11]</a></sup> as <i>Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru</i> <span style="font-weight: normal;">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" xml:lang="ja" lang="ja">数字は独身に限る</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display: none;"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display: none;">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji"><i>Suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru</i></span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="padding: 0pt 0.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 238); font-family: sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; font-size: 80%; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; text-decoration: none;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, which can be translated as "the digits must be single" or "the digits are limited to one occurrence."
